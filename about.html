					<p>The BEET is a community arts magazine based in Boone, North Carolina. It is a place where artists of all mediums-drawing, painting, literature, and music- can showcase their work.</p>
					<h3>history</h3>
					<p>The BEET was first conceptualized in october 2012 by <span>Lauren Lockamy</span>, <span>Hayes Crowley</span>, and <span>Harper Robinson</span> in the sleepy college town of Boone, NC, to curb existential anxiety about their career choices (or lack thereof). BEETzine's motive is to bring inspiration to all, because if you're creating/being inspired, then nothings wasted. we aim to be a non-judgmental, safe space, that is open to all sorts of groovy beings. four tree issues to date, many great promotional shows, and two free mixtapes featuring local Boone bands. we want you to submit any and all art forms. This means music, writing, visual art, photography, comics, short stories, etc., which have all been in the zine and are welcome in upcoming issues.</p>
					<h3>submit</h3>
					<p>BEET encourages everybody in Boone, NC who has got art junk, tall tales or poetry to submit them to beetboone@gmail.com</p>
